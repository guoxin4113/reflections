When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you have no access to your local computer.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if there are multiple person works on the same repository, you might not always want to be up-dated with other people's work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is from GitHub to GitHub, clone is from GitHub to local or b/t local. Branch is for same repository.
